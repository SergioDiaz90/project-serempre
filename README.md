## Sumary construction project

Well, in the creation of this project, try to recreate several cases that allow me to show a little of the different skills that I handle, both with the angular framework although there are still more things that could be done with it, and the use of html and css over sass.

One of the most challenging things was to create the blue border of the photos in the carousel, I took too much time with it and in the end I achieved a solution that is not bad but I still don't think it is the best because I only changed the event.

One of the things that I tried to do the most was the recreation of the information to consume it dynamically, since it is very common that in the SPA there is a consumption of API.

It was also very challenging to not be able to be 100% focused on the test.
